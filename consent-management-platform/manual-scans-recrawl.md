# Manual Scans (Recrawl)

TRUENDO automatically scans your website once a month to check for any changes to services/cookies and updates banners and policies accordingly. This is usually enough to keep your website compliant. If however you feel that a change has been made and you would like to initiate a manual scan and update, you may do so.

## How to initiate a manual scan

1.  <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Login in to TRUENDO and </span></span> **select the website** you wish to scan.
2.  Click on **Settings** in the panel on the left
3.  Scroll down to the **Domain** section and click **Re-scan this domain**. Easy as 1-2-3.
